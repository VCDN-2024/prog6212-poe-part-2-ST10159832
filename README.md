In order to take advantage of ASP.NET MVC's web-based architecture, I moved from WPF to this framework. Because of the MVC framework, it is possible to clearly divide concerns, which improves the codebase's maintainability and scalability. Furthermore, the ClaimViewModel's implementation of model validation guarantees data integrity, and Razor views enable a more user-friendly interface, enhancing the entire user experience. The objectives of my claims management system are more closely aligned with this transformation. The project named KeenanGhisyan_ST10159832_ProgPartTwo is my final project as the other project crashed as the last moment so i had to restart it.
